## Who Did What?

Sathvi added the paths to the audio files and created buttons that plays the sound for the note when pressed.
Gia did the styling, put in the audio files, and added functionality to play the audio files.

## What you learned

How to use Expo and React Native! We had some merging issues but figured it out and it was nice practice that helped us get back into the flow of using git.
